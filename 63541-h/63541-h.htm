  <h2 class='c007'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The Author of the following sheets
is well aware of the objections which
may be made to the performance but
hopes the candour of the public will
excuse those defects, which the nature
of the undertaking rendered it almost
impossible to avoid. The pointed satire
of ridicule, which would perhaps
have given a zest to those scenes in
which the subject of these pages was
engaged, was not, in the opinion of
the writer, at all proper for those
readers for whom it was solely designed:
to exhibit their superiors in
a ridiculous view, is not the proper
method to engage the youthful mind
to respect: to represent their equals
as the objects of contemptuous mirth,
is by no means favourable to the interest
of good-nature: and to treat the
characters of their inferiors with levity,
the Author thought was inconsistent
with the sacred rights of humanity.
Circumscribed therefore to the narrow
boundaries of simple narrative, it has
been the design of the following pages,
carefully to avoid exciting any wrong
impression, and, by sometimes blending
<i>instruction</i> and <i>amusement</i>, to make
it the more easily retained.</p>

<p class='c009'>To multiply incidents in these circumstances,
was a very difficult task,
especially, as it was wished to make
them arise naturally from the subject;
and not obtrude unnecessarily without
any seeming cause to produce them.
The avidity with which children peruse
books of entertainment, is a proof
how much publications proper for their
attention are required. Though the
sentiments should be suited to their
simplicity, they ought to be expressed
with propriety; since a taste for elegance
may be insensibly acquired;
and we should always <i>endeavour</i> to
present them with proper models of
imitation. Conscious of the difficulty
of the undertaking, the Author of
these adventures will gladly have
declined the task, in the expectation
of such a work’s engaging the attention
of those, whose genius were more
equal to its accomplishment. With
the hope, therefore, of inspiring others
to excel the example, it is now submitted
to the world “with all its imperfections
on its head,” trusting for
a candid reception to the motive
which first suggested the idea: <i>That
of presenting the juvenile reader with a
a few pages which should be innocent of
corrupting, if they did not amuse</i>.</p>

</div>
<p class='c008'>It happened one very fine afternoon in the
latter end of <i>May</i>, that Mrs. <i>Airy</i> had been collecting
together a great number of different
pieces of silk, in order to made a work-bag;
which she intended as a present to one of her
nieces. Miss <i>Martha Airy</i>, her eldest daughter,
was about ten years old, and had been for
some time indolently lolling with both her
elbows on the table, looking at her Mamma
while she was chusing the prettiest pattern for
the purpose I just mentioned. Her chin rested
on her two hands, which were crossed over
each other, and she was seated on the back of
her brother’s chair, which he had turned down
in that manner for the purpose of serving him
as a horse. At last, however, her weight proving
too great for the seat she had chosen, as
she did not keep still, the upper part of the
chair-back came to the ground, while the
other end mounted up like a piece of board
for a sea-saw; and in her fall tumbling down
backwards, proved the occasion of a great
deal of mischief, by oversetting a curious set
of tea-china, which her sister <i>Charlotte</i> was
playing with; and which she had received as
a present the day before from her grandpapa.
<i>Charlotte</i> was so enraged at the loss of her play-things,
that without offering to help her sister,
she gave her a slap on the face, and told her,
she was very naughty to spoil things in such a
manner by her carelessness; and that she would
break her plates whenever they came in her
way. She was proceeding in this manner
when Mrs. <i>Airy</i> thought it time to interfere,
and was extremely angry with <i>Charlotte</i> for her
warmth. “<i>Martha</i> was not to blame,” added
she, “as she had no intention of doing the
least mischief to your cups and saucers. I
think, as I told her once before, she was not
sitting in a graceful attitude, and had she
moved at the time I spoke to her, it would
have prevented her fall; but that is no justification
of your behaviour to your sister. She
has not deserved your reproaches, and I did
not think you could have behaved so improperly,
as well as unkindly, as to strike anyone,
especially your elder sister. Indeed I am much
displeased with you, and the threat you made
of breaking her plates in return, is so very
naughty and wicked, that I think you deserve
to be punished; and I desire you will ask <i>Martha</i>’s
pardon for the blow you have given her.”
<i>Charlotte</i> coloured with indignation and anger,
at the thoughts of submitting in such a manner
to humble herself. She had heard some
silly girls declare, they would never own their
being in the wrong, and was withheld from
acting in the noblest manner, by the false
shame of confessing an error. At length however,
upon her Mamma coming towards her
with an avowed intention of inflicting some
further punishment, she mumbled out, in a low
voice, which was very difficult to be understood,
That she was sorry that she had struck
her sister. <i>Martha</i>, who was extremely generous,
and uncommonly good-natured, very affectionately
kissed her sister; and told her, she
was much concerned at the mischief she had
occasioned; though she could not have helped
it; as she fell down before she was aware of it,
and did not see that her tea-things were near
her. <i>Charlotte</i> grew reconciled by degrees; but
it was a long time before she regained her usual
cheerfulness. After some time, however, the
sisters seated themselves in a window by the
table, and solicited their Mamma for a bit of
silk to make a <i>Pincushion</i>. Mrs. <i>Airy</i> gave them
several pieces to chuse which they liked best;
and after they had taken them up a dozen
times, or perhaps as many more, had they
been reckoned, <i>Martha</i> made a choice of a
square piece of pink sattin, which she neatly
sewed and stuffed with bran, and which, gentle
reader, when it was finished, was the identical
<i>Pincushion</i> whose adventures form the
subject of this little volume. Assuming, therefore,
the title of an Historian, or Biographer,
which is generally understood to mean a person
who is writing an account of his own, or
another’s actions, I shall take the liberty to
speak for myself, and tell you what I saw and
heard in the character of a <i>Pincushion</i>. Perhaps
you never thought that such things as are inanimate,
could be sensible of any thing which
happens, as they can neither hear, see, nor
understand; and as I would not willingly mislead
your judgment: I would previous to your
reading this work, inform you, that it is to be
understood as an imaginary tale; in the same
manner as when you are at play, you sometimes
call yourselves gentlemen, and ladies,
though you know you are only little boys or
girls. So, when you read of birds and beads
speaking and thinking, you know it is not so
in reality, any more than your amusements,
which you frequently call <i>making believe</i>. To
use your own style, and adopt your own manner
of speaking, therefore, you must imagine,
that a <i>Pincushion</i> is now <i>making believe</i> to address
you, and to recite a number of little events,
some of which really have happened, and
others might do so with great probability: and
if any of the characters here represented should
appear to be disagreeable, the Author hopes
you will endeavour to avoid their failings, and
to practice those virtues or accomplishments,
which render the contrary examples more
worthy of imitation. And now, if you please,
we will return to the account of what further
befell me in the family of Mrs. <i>Airy</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the young ladies had amused themselves
a great while with the pieces of silk
I have so often had occasion to mention, and
Miss <i>Martha</i> had completed me to her entire
satisfaction; she took all the pins out of an
old green one, which was originally in the
shape of a heart, but had, by looping a great
part of its inside, through various little holes,
quite lost its form; and which, that she might
find those pins which had gone through the
silk, she cut open on an old news-paper, and
then stuck all she could find upon my sides in
the shape of letters, which she afterwards
changed to flowers, and a third time altered
to stars and circles; which afforded her full
amusement till bed time. Miss <i>Charlotte</i>,
though her mamma had given her as much silk
as her sister, had only cut it into waste; while
<i>Martha</i>, after she had furnished me, had saved
the rest towards making a housewife for her
doll. I could not help reflecting when I saw
all <i>Charlotte</i>’s little shreds and slips littering
the room; what a simple method many little
girls are apt to get into, of wasting every thing
which their friends are so kind as to give them,
and which, properly employed, might, make
them many useful ornaments for their dolls;
and sometimes pretty trifles for themselves.
<i>Charlotte Airy</i> as such children usually are,
was desirous of having every thing she saw,
so that her drawers were always filled with
bits of ribbon, pieces of silk, cuttings of gauze,
catgut, and muslin: and if she wanted to find
her gloves, tippet, tuckers, or any part of her
dress, she was obliged to search for them in
twenty different places, and frequently to go
without what she was looking for. <i>Martha</i>
on the contrary, by taking care of what might
be of use, and laying it by in a proper place,
always knew where to find what she had occasion
for directly. So that it frequently happened
that she went out with her Mamma,
when her sister was forced to stay at home; because
she had lost something which had delayed
her so long to lock for, that she could not get
ready in time. This very circumstance happened
the day after I became acquainted with
her, to her no small mortification. Mrs. <i>Airy</i>
was going to see the exhibition of pictures, at
the <i>Royal Academy</i>, and told her daughters if
they behaved well they should accompany her;
as Mrs. <i>Gardner</i> and her niece Miss <i>Lounge</i>
would call at one o’clock. After breakfast,
<i>Charlotte</i>, who had found the mould of an old
button in one of her papa’s waistcoat pockets
which she had been rummaging, had cut to pieces
an axle-tree of a little cart, which belonged
to her brother, to make a spindle, in
order to convert it into a tea-totum; with
which she was so much entertained, that she
was very unwilling to leave it to go to work,
though her mamma repeatedly told her, she
would not be ready against Mr. <i>Gardner</i>’s coach
came. “Yes, I shall, Madam!” said she, and
played on. “Do pray go to work, <i>Charlotte</i>!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i017.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Presently, Madam.” But still she thought
she would give it another twirl. “You shall
not go if you have not finished your morning
business!” “In a minute I will!” And so she
simply idled away her time, without heeding
her mamma’s admonition, till near an hour
beyond her usual time of beginning. This put
her into such a hurry to finish when she found
it was so late, that she stitched some wristbands
she was about, and which were intended for
her grandpapa, so very badly, they were obliged
to be undone; which made her so cross,
that in pulling out the work, she broke the
threads of the cloth, and entirely spoiled it.
<i>Charlotte</i> was a very fair complexioned pretty
girl; but you cannot imagine how ugly her
ill-humour made her appear; nor how much
more agreeable her sister looked, who was
much browner, was pitted with the small pox,
and a much plainer child. I surveyed them
both as I lay on the table, where my Mistress
had placed me to stick her pins as she took
out of the shirt collar which she was putting
on; <i>Martha</i> looked so placid and cheerful,
and seemed to speak so kindly when she
asked a question, that it made her really
charming; while <i>Charlotte</i>, who had a very
pretty mouth, and very regular features, stuck
out her lips in a manner so unbecoming, and
tossed about her head with such very illiberal
jirks that she lost all natural advantages in
her wilful ill-humour.</p>

<p class='c009'>A person happening to call on Mrs. <i>Airy</i>, to
speak about some particular business, she left
the children to attend him; and <i>Martha</i>, who
pitied her sister’s distress, and saw the impossibility
of her finishing the task she was ordered
to do, very kindly offered to assist her,
without which, she never could have accomplished
it. But their mamma at her return,
immediately suspected the case to be as I have
told you, and inquired what help <i>Charlotte</i> had
received in her absence? They were both girls
of too much honour to deny the truth, and in
consequences of her frankly owning her sister’s
kindness, Mrs. <i>Airy</i>, permitted her to retire;
in order to prepare for the intended expedition;
but alas! poor <i>Charlotte</i>, who indeed was
not always so good as she ought to have been,
was not to go that morning, although her mamma
had consented to it. <i>Betty</i>, who came to put
on her frock, was not very fond of her, for
she was sometimes apt, when her mamma was
not in the way, to speak very haughtily, and in
a manner quite unbecoming a young lady.
Unfortunately she forgot herself on the present
occasion, and very rudely said, “You must
come and dress me, and you must make haste,
or I shall not be ready.” “<i>Must I?</i>” replied <i>Betty</i>,
“That is if <i>I please</i>, Miss <i>Charlotte</i>, though you,
forgot to put that in, and unless you speak in
a prettier way, I will not help you at all.”
“Then you may let it alone, for I will not ask
you any otherwise,” and away she went, banging
the door after her, to call her sister, who
was ready and waiting for the coach in her
mamma’s room. <i>Martha</i> ran directly, and
began to pin her frock as she desired. But a
new distress arose, for as she was too careless
ever to retain any of my fellow-servants (commonly
called a <i>Pincushion</i>) in her service, so she
had not one pin to proceed with after three,
which had stuck at one end of me, had been
employed. Neither of them chose to apply to
<i>Betty</i>, because they were sure from <i>Charlotte</i>’s
ill-behaviour to be denied: and she would not
permit her sister to ask her mamma, for fear
of an inquiry which might not turn out to her
credit. So, in short, they both traversed the
room backwards and forwards, and were quite
overjoyed when they found two, (one of which
proved to be crooked) between the joining of
the floor. Then they each returned and took
me up repeatedly, and examined me over and
over, though they were convinced I had been
empty long ago. At last, a loud rap at the
door announced Mrs. <i>Gardner</i>’s arrival. The
ladies were called, and <i>Martha</i> obeyed, though
with reluctance to leave her sister: and <i>Charlotte</i>,
with conscious shame, and remorse for
her past conduct, and heart-heaving sobs of
disappointment, saw them drive away without
her. I was left upon the table in the
hurry of my mistress’s departure, and <i>Charlotte</i>
took me up, and earnestly wished she had had
a pincushion of her own: and so I should think
would any one who had experienced the want
of such a useful companion; though unless well
furnished with pins, it is in itself but of little
assistance, as—she had but too unfortunately
found. The slatternly appearance, and real
inconvenience, which many ladies suffer from
neglecting to provide themselves with and retaining
a few such necessary implements of
female œconomy about them, is really inconceivable
by any person accustomed to a proper
degree of attention. <i>Trifles</i> are frequently regarded
by the giddy and thoughtless as of no
moment, when <i>essentials</i> are taken care of: but
it is the repetition of <i>trifles</i> which constitutes
the chief business of our existence. In other
words, people form their opinion of a young
lady from her personal appearance; and if,
because she is at work, and in want of pins,
and destitute of a <i>Pincushion</i>, she has quite undressed
herself, and her cloaths are dropping
off, she will be thought a negligent slattern;
which, I suppose, is what no one would chuse
to be esteemed: so, when children accustom
themselves to loll their elbows, stoop their
heads, stand upon one foot, bite their nails,
or any other ungraceful actions, it makes them
disagreeable, and the object of dislike to all
their friends, and every one who is acquainted
with them. And it is very foolish to imagine,
that because they are not in company
with <i>strangers</i> it does not signify; for ill-habits,
when once they are acquired, are very difficult
to leave off; and by being used to do an
impolite action frequently, they will do it
without recollecting the impropriety; when
if they thought, perhaps, they would have on
no account been guilty of it.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id008'>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Miss <i>Lounge</i>, the young lady who accompanied
Mrs. <i>Airy</i> to the exhibition was a striking
example of what I mention above. She
was about sixteen, and very tall of her age;
so that she appeared quite womanly in person,
though her manners were to the highest degree
remarkable unpleasing, she had a strange way
of tossing her legs round at every step, as if she
was making circles, and her arms were crossed
over each other in so awkward a manner, and
so unfashionably low, that it made her still
more ungraceful in her appearance: besides
this, she had acquired a drawling tone in conversation,
which made her completely an object
of disgust: as it was entirely the consequence
of her own neglect, and therefore,
was by no means deserving of that pity which
is due to every natural defect, or accidental
deformity. She returned with her aunt to
dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss <i>Charlotte</i> was quite ashamed of entering
the drawing room, though she was now
dressed, and had promised Mrs. <i>Betty</i> she would
behave with more civility for the future. But
the fear of her mamma’s exposing her folly
to Mrs. <i>Gardner</i>, had made her dislike to show
herself in company; and the consciousness of
having deserved reproof, made her justly apprehensive
of receiving it. She did not venture
down stairs, therefore, till dinner was on
the table; and then with her neck and face
as red as blushes could make them, she paid
her compliments to the company, without
daring to look at her mamma. So cowardly
and uncomfortable does the thought of a wrong
action make those who have committed it,
even when they are not certain it will be publicly
known. And this reminds me of a few
stanzas I found in Miss <i>Martha</i>’s work-bag one
day, when she put me into it with her scissars,
(by mistake I suppose) as my proper place was
certainly in her pocket. But as they are so
very apropos to my present subject, I will
present my readers with them: and as the author
is quite unknown, if they should not be
thought deserving of a favourable reception,
they will not at least subject the writer to
any mortification.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. <i>Airy</i> was so generous as not to expose
her daughter’s folly before Mrs. <i>Gardner</i>; and
as she had met with a severe punishment in the
consequence of her fault, and had promised
amendment for the future, after a gentle reprimand,
when she came down the next morning,
nothing further passed on the subject.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id010'>
<img src='images/i029.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'><i>Charlotte</i> was so conscious of her late misbehaviour,
that she had scarce courage to inquire
what entertainment they had received from a
sight of the pictures at the exhibition; and <i>Martha</i>,
who was extremely delicate and attentive,
very cautiously avoided the subject, from fear
of appearing to insult her sister, or to remind
her mamma of the reason which had occasioned
her absence from the party. Mrs. <i>Airy</i> inquired
whether <i>Martha</i> had not particularly
taken notice of a large picture, which represented
the death of Earl <i>Goodwin</i>. She replied,
that Mrs. <i>Gardner</i> had pointed it out to
her observation; but that she had not remarked
any particulars, except the figure of a King,
and a large company at dinner. “I will tell
you the story then, my dear, to which this
picture refers,” said Mrs. <i>Airy</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the reign of <i>Edward</i> the Confessor, in the
year 1042, Earl <i>Goodwin</i>, who had been accessary
to the murder of Prince <i>Alfred</i>, was at
dinner with the King at <i>Windsor</i>; and taking
a piece of bread, called God to witness his innocence,
and wished if he uttered any thing but
the truth, that the next mouthful he ate might
choak him. Which accordingly happened,
and the bread stuck in his throat and he died
immediately at the table. Do not you think
my dear,” added Mrs. <i>Airy</i>, “it was a just punishment
for his untruth, and an awful judgment
for calling God to witness a falsehood?” “Indeed,
Madam, I think it was quite dreadful:
but are you sure that this account is true? for
though it is certainly very wicked to tell a lie
on any occasion, yet, as sometimes many people
are thus guilty, I wonder that such events
do not more frequently happen! You know
that Miss <i>Riby</i> said she had not been writing
last week, although you saw that her fingers
were inked; and <i>Charlotte</i> had seen her doing
it; why then, did not the same accident happen
to her?” “Because, my love, the punishment
of such crimes does not always immediately
follow the commission of them; but
you may be sure that the remorse of conscience,
and the secret uneasiness of mind which
the guilty suffer, is a very great unhappiness;
and the apprehension and the fear of a future
account after death, besides the idea of present
detection, is such a degree of misery as no other
punishment can equal. As to your question,
whether I believe this account to be true? I
certainly do! It was an extraordinary event
which was recorded at the time it happened,
and which every historian has mentioned since,
and faithfully transmitted to us. This is the
best authority we can have for any fact which
happened before our own time, and is therefore
entitled to our belief. But why such examples
are so rare, is not to be wondered at; because
you know that wicked people will be
punished hereafter; and though such instances
sometimes happen, to teach others to be good,
and to make them afraid of doing what will
make them liable to such terrible vengeance,
yet, in general, a crime of this kind does not
meet with immediate chastisement; because,
after death, as I have before told you, those
who have been wicked, will suffer such misery
as their sins deserved. Besides which, the liar
is at present detested by every one, and loses
all the advantage of confidence, and the pleasure
of being believed: even when he does
speak truth, he is liable to be suspected, and
his word is doubted on all occasions.” The
conversation was here interrupted by the arrival
of two young ladies and their mamma,
who came to pay a morning visit to Mrs. <i>Airy</i>;
but as they did not say any thing worth the
attention of my readers, I shall not trouble
myself to repeat more of what passed than may
be imagined, from the comments of my mistress
and her sister, with which I shall present them.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id011'>
<img src='images/i033.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'><i>Martha</i>, before the room door was well shut
after them, began to observe that the eldest
Miss <i>Chantillon</i> was very ugly, and very stupid;
and the youngest a good pretty girl, and talked
a great deal indeed. “I wish,” added she, “I
could speak as fast as she does.” “To talk so fast,
my love,” said her mamma, “is by no means any
accomplishment; and I am far from your opinion,
in so highly admiring the merits of Miss
<i>Lucy</i>. She chatters so fast, as frequently not
to be understood: and has a very silly trick
of beginning every sentence with a laugh,
than which nothing can be more ill-bred. The
person, who is speaking, should never laugh,
if she can help it, at her own wit, if she design
to excite mirth, or to meet with approbation
from others. But without any such intention,
<i>Lucy</i> assumes an affected giggle whenever she
attempts to speak. She has likewise a very
unbecoming pertness in her manner, and, by frequent
interruptions, when her elders are otherwise
engaged, renders herself extremely disagreeable.
I would have you, my good girls,
possess that desirable degree of proper courage,
as never to feel ashamed of speaking when it is
necessary; but I think it is an unpleasing sight
to perceive a young woman, or child I should
say, for <i>Lucy</i> is young enough for that epithet,
affecting to understand every thing, and giving
her opinion unasked, upon subjects which frequently
expose her ignorance an presumption.
This is aiming at a character to which she has
no pretensions; and by wishing to rise into a
woman, before she has reached the age of understanding,
she is despised for her vanity, and
loses that esteem she might have attained by a
proper degree of humility, and a better knowledge
of her station. This observation, my
dear <i>Martha</i>, I would particularly address to
you; as you are generally thought uncommonly
tall, and are usually imagined to be much older
than you are. This I know you fancy to be a
compliment, which always appears to give you
pleasure? but remember, that, if you assume
airs of womanhood, and affect to be thought
further advanced in age, you will have the less
allowance made for any errors you may commit,
and consequently meet with contempt
where you might otherwise have escaped censure.
Youth, and inexperience, are justly allowed
to excuse any slight inadvertence in manners,
or want of grace in appearance; but if
you chuse to be thought of more consequence,
you must likewise expect, that the notice you
may attract will not always be favourable to
your vanity. I assure you, I think Miss <i>Jenny
Chantillon</i> is much more agreeable than her
sister, as she has courage sufficient to reply to
any question, and to speak distinctly when she
is particularly addressed, without inquiring,
in <i>Lucy</i>’s manner, into the reason of every
word which is uttered, and deciding every argument
according to her own fancy: and, I
dare say, if you will be careful to observe, you
will find that <i>Jenny</i> always meets with attention
from the company, while <i>Lucy</i> is frequently
insulted, by being enjoined to silence, and by
her hearers turning from her with disdain. In
short, my dear, it requires a great deal of thought
and propriety, to behave in an agreeable manner
at your age. It is best not to be anxious to be
taken notice of, since that eagerness always
defeats its aim. Girls have not had the advantage
of experience to teach them wisdom;
and when once they are engaged in conversation,
and find themselves attended to, their
volatile spirits hurry them on, with the desire of
obtaining applause for their wit, to say things
which are sometimes neither delicate nor prudent;
and which they may, when they have
time to reflect, long have reason to repent
having imprudently uttered. Any restraint at
such a time, is, I know, always esteemed an ill-natured
interruption, and is apt to damp their
harmony, and lower their spirits. I would
therefore warn you of the danger before-hand,
that your own prudence may be a check to
that unlimited indulgence, which at such a
period is liable to excess: and, I dare say, that
your good sense will teach you, that my admonitions
are always intended for your advantage.
To impress this deeper upon your mind, I will
repeat to you a few lines which were written
to me, when I was young, by my aunt, and
which, as they frequently occurred to my
memory, I found to be singularly useful.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ladies now all retired to dinner, but I
am ignorant of what passed there, as I was left
upon a piece of embroidery, which my mistress
was covering with some white paper to keep it
clean: and she did not fetch me till after tea;
when she carried me in her hand down stairs
with her work, to show some ladies who were
assembled in the drawing room. I then accompanied
her into what was usually called
the green parlour, as the furniture was all of
that colour; whither she went to play with
her young visiters, whose names were <i>Eliza
Meekly</i> and <i>Julia Norris</i>.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id011'>
<img src='images/i038.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>They amused themselves with playing on
the Harpsichord, while Miss <i>Martha</i> personated
the music-master, and <i>Charlotte</i> chose to teach
them dancing. Some part of the evening
they played at going to the exhibition; and
just as they determined to visit the pictures,
the footman came to acquaint the young ladies,
that their coach was ready. Miss <i>Meekly</i>’s
bib was unpinned, and <i>Martha</i> gave me into
her hand in a hurry, while she was looking
for her cloak. So without recollecting that
I was another’s property, <i>Eliza</i> put me into
her pocket, made a very elegant courtesy, and
stepped into the carriage. I felt really very
sorry to part from a family with which I had
been some time connected; and to one of whom
I owed my being a <i>Pincushion</i>. But my new
mistress was so very engaging, that I was in
hopes she would take care of me, and not leave
me about to the mercy of a little kitten, who
jumped into her lap the moment she got home;
and who afterwards frisked away with a little
tassel which dropped off from one corner of a
work-bag which lay on the table. But before
I proceed with my history, it will be necessary
to introduce my readers to Miss <i>Meekly</i>
and her companions, and to make them better
acquainted with this new family, who are all
of them deserving their notice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. <i>Stanley</i>, to whom the house belonged,
was the widow of a clergyman, who had at
his death left her in rather indigent circumstances;
and she had been advised (to support
herself and two younger sisters who lived with
her) to take a small number of young ladies
to board. Her number was confined to six;
two of whom were those I have above mentioned.
The others were three sisters, whose
names were <i>Saxby</i>, and a Miss <i>Una</i>; who, for
her sweetness of temper, and excellence in
every accomplishment, was esteemed superior
to all the rest of her companions. <i>Harriet Una</i>,
was cousin to Miss <i>Meekly</i>, and they usually
slept together. She was just turned of thirteen,
was tall and large; had light brown hair, blue
eyes, and a fine complexion: but her good-nature
and willingness to oblige every one,
made her the general favourite, and recommended
her to universal esteem.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the young ladies retired to bed, <i>Eliza</i>
found me in her pocket, and told <i>Harriet</i>, she
was afraid Miss <i>Airy</i> would want her <i>Pincushion</i>;
and she was the more concerned, as the family
were to go into the country very early the
next morning, and she should have no opportunity
to return it. However, continued she,
“I will make a new one to present to Miss <i>Airy</i>
when I see her; and I will keep this, as I
have not one at present, my kitten having
pulled mine to pieces this morning: but I will
take care this shall not come to the same mischance.”
I was glad to hear that was her intention,
as I should by no means have liked
the thought of sharing the fate of my predecessor.
At this time Mrs. <i>Stanley</i> entered the
room to wish them a good-night, and to see
whether they were properly taken care of. “I
am very unhappy to-night,” said <i>Eliza</i>, as soon
as she was gone: “and I feel ashamed of receiving
Mrs. <i>Stanley</i>’s kisses, because I behaved in
a manner I am sure she would not approve.”
“What have you done, my dear cousin,” replied
<i>Harriet</i>, “to make you so uneasy?” “I will tell you,”
answered Miss <i>Meekly</i>, “though I do not like to
confess my weakness. Just before dinner,
Miss <i>Charlotte Airy</i> asked me to eat some preserved
plums, which she said had been made
a present of to her Mamma, and which came
from <i>Portugal</i>. They were very sweet and
luscious, and as I am not allowed to have any
thing of that kind, I refused her offer. But
when we had dined, she pressed me again, and
laughed at me very much for being so foolish,
as to imagine any thing so innocent could hurt
me; but supposed, as I went to <i>school</i>, my <i>mistress</i>,
for so she sneeringly called Mrs. <i>Stanley</i>,
would <i>whip</i> me if I did. At last, overcome
with her persecutions, and vexed to be treated
so much like a baby, and as if I was afraid of
punishment, I took the plum, and have not
been easy since. And now, my dear <i>Harriet</i>,
what shall I do? Suppose Mrs. <i>Stanley</i> should
ask me whether I have eaten any thing lately
which I ought not: and if she does not put
that question, I feel so undeserving of her caresses,
that she will see by my looks I have
behaved improperly.” “I am very sorry,” replied
Miss <i>Una</i>; “but as you are so sensible it was
wrong, I may spare my recriminations. However,
I think the noblest reparation you can
now make, would be honestly to inform Mrs.
<i>Stanley</i> of the crime, and the sincerity of your
regret for having been guilty of it: should it
be discovered by any other means, you will
forfeit her esteem, and lose that confidence,
with which you are at present favoured; by
such an unsolicited confession, you will restore
satisfaction to your own conscience, and be
certain of her approbation.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Eliza</i> was convinced of the propriety and
justice of her friend’s advice, and promised to
comply with it the next morning. But her
excessive timidity prevented her making use
of several opportunities which presented,
though the subject occupied all her attention,
and she could scarce think of any thing else.
She again applied therefore to <i>Harriet</i>, and told
her it was impossible for her to summon up
courage to do as she had desired; and begged
she would, from her, acquaint Mrs. <i>Stanley</i>
with what had happened. Miss <i>Una</i>, in the
mildest terms, complied with her request; at
the same time very generously commending
her honour on every occasion, and urging her
present uneasiness to engage Mrs. <i>Stanley</i>’s
compassion. Miss <i>Meekly</i>, when she was acquainted
with her cousin’s having revealed
this secret, which had oppressed her mind,
was very unwilling to attend her to the lady
above-mentioned. Mrs. <i>Stanley</i> received her
with the greatest affection and tenderness; and
after expressing, in the warmest terms, her
approbation of such a generous confession,
added, “You need never, my dear girl, be
afraid either of anger, or punishment, when
with such a degree of frankness, you acknowledge
any fault you have committed. Be assured,
your friends will be always willing to
pardon those errors which you promise to amend:
but let the present instance warn you,
my <i>Eliza</i>, never to be led into actions which
you know are improper, because the company
you are with may ridicule your refusal. Miss
<i>Charlotte Airy</i> is, in my opinion, a very naughty
girl, to endeavour to persuade you to do any
thing which you have been forbidden. And
I hope from the remorse you have suffered,
you will reflect on the folly of complying with
any proposals, which your conscience suggests
to you is wrong. Do not be afraid of being
laughed at for being good. Every person of
real sense will esteem you for your resolution:
and because a silly girl may <i>sneer</i> at your apprehension
of punishment, it will be much more
ridiculous, and wicked at the same time, to be
guilty of what you are conscious is a crime,
for which you will <i>deserve</i>, and perhaps <i>receive</i>
correction. Besides, <i>one</i> bad action, is but too
often the cause of the commission of others;
and when once we have deviated from what
is right in a small instance, it is frequently the
occasion of accumulated guilt. I will tell you
an instance of this kind that may illustrate my
meaning, and which, as I was acquainted with
the person who is the subject of it, will perhaps
make a deeper impression on your mind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A young lady, whose real name I shall (for
the sake of charity) conceal under that of
<i>Lloyd</i>, and who was, my dear <i>Eliza</i>, nearly of
the same age with yourself, was educated with
the utmost attention; and as she was an only
child, was the darling of her parents, and the
centre of all their future expectations. <i>Betsey</i>,
which was her usual appellation, went one day
to visit a companion, with whom she was extremely
intimate; but who unfortunately for
her, was not possessed of that strict honour which
should be the basis and foundation of friendship.
When they had been for some time
at play in the garden, she proposed to go back
to a little shop in the neighbourhood to make
a purchase of some gingerbread; and though
Miss <i>Lloyd</i> for a time objected to the proposal
without leave, against her mamma’s repeated
command; yet, her companion’s laughing at
her squeamishness (as she wickedly called an
adherence to her duty) prevailed over her better
resolutions, and she accompanied her to
the place I mentioned. As it was the only
shop of the kind which the village afforded,
the boys of an adjacent school very frequently
went there for the same purpose, as the two
young ladies who now entered; and two of
the most unlucky of their number, happened
at that time to be bargaining for some balls.
They staid very soberly till Miss <i>Lloyd</i> had
taken out her purse to pay for the cakes she
had purchased; but as the lock of her pocket
book was entangled in it, it came out of her
pocket at the same time, when one of the boys
snatched it from her hand, and rudely declared
he would see its contents, and know
all the girl’s secrets. This vexed her extremely,
and she thoughtlessly pursued him, as he
ran away with the prize, till she was a good
way from home. He was joined by several
of his school-fellows, who took part with him,
and behaved in so wild a manner as to terrify
her greatly. At length, however, she got
away from them, and ran back with all the
speed in her power: but as it was later than
her usual time of returning, her parents were
uneasy, and questioned her with great tenderness
and anxiety, as to the reason of her stay.
She told them, she had been out with Miss
<i>Hannah</i> (the companion she had really visited)
and her maid, and that a horse had been near
running over her, which had frightened her
so much, as to prevent her return.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id014'>
<img src='images/i048.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>“This story was believed by Mr. and Mrs.
<i>Lloyd</i> for some time, and <i>Betsey</i> who had at first
been very unhappy at the thoughts of such a
wicked deceit, at length grew reconciled as
she found herself undetected. She therefore
ventured upon a second transgression, from
the encouragement which she foolishly imagined
the secresy her first fault had given her;
and with her intimate Miss <i>Hannah</i> took another
walk, without any person to have the
care of them. But during their absence from
home, an unexpected accident punished the
imprudent Miss <i>Lloyd</i> for her disobedience and
untruth, in a manner which will give her
cause for repentance to the latest period of her
life; for as she was crossing a road in her return,
a horse which had been tied to the rails
of a house a little distance, broke the bridle
which confined him, and gallopped away full
speed, unrestrained by any opposition, till in
his passage the unfortunate Miss <i>Lloyd</i>, who
did not perceive his approach, was thrown
down, and broke her leg in such a terrible
manner, as to occasion her being a cripple
ever after. She has since confessed, the consciousness
of her falsehood was such a conviction
to her mind of the wickedness of her
conduct, (when she was made sensible that the
accident was the consequence of her disobedience
to her parents) that it was more difficult
to support, than any bodily uneasiness
she had suffered; and the reflections that they
would never be able to confide in her for the
future, was the occasion of so much self-reproach,
as to deprive her of every enjoyment.
This instance may serve to convince you, that
a slight error is very frequently without any
previous intention; and when least expected,
the occasion of such crimes, as in the cooler
moments of thought (that is, when you have
time to reflect on the wickedness of the action)
you would never be capable of committing;
and as none can be sure they would be able to
resist temptation, it is best never to do any
thing which you know to be wrong, though
it may appear to be in the smallest instance,
since the desire of concealing a <i>trifling</i> fault,
may lead you to hide it by a falsehood, which
is one of the <i>greatest</i> you can be guilty of.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id015'>
<img src='images/i050.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>Miss <i>Meekly</i> was convinced of the truth and
propriety of this argument, and promised to
be more attentive for her future conduct. She
then joined her companions with that cheerful
good-humour, which distinguished her character,
and attended them into the great parlour,
where they usually spent the morning. When
they had concluded their work, writing, &amp;c.
Mrs. <i>Stanley</i> always made them read to her,
and encouraged them to ask any question which
occurred to them; to make their own observations
upon those passages in history which
struck their imaginations; or to propose to
her any objection, which arose in their minds.
She desired them to ask the meaning and origin
of those customs they did not comprehend;
and by so doing, had frequent opportunities of
improving their understandings. Instances of
this kind very frequently occurred, and supplied
them with subjects of conversation. Miss
<i>Una</i> was working a map of <i>England</i>, and inquired
one day how long the island had been
divided into shires and counties. Mrs. <i>Stanley</i>
applied to the young ladies to know if any
of them could resolve the question, but as they
were all silent, “you should endeavour, my
dears, said she, to remember what you read, or
it will be of very little advantage. I believe
<i>Harriet</i>, you read an account of this division a
few months ago, when you were going through
the reigns of the <i>Saxon</i> Monarchs. Do not
you remember that the great King <i>Alfred</i>, in
the year 886 repaired the city of <i>London</i>, which
had been burnt by the <i>Danes</i> in 839, and that
he afterwards divided the kingdom into shires,
hundreds, and tithings?” “I did not recollect it,”
said Miss <i>Una</i>. “But pray,” added Miss <i>Saxby</i>,
“did the same king set up all the crosses, for I
remember something about their being erected,
though I have forgotten when it happened.”
“Your memory is very short I am afraid,”
replied Mrs. <i>Stanley</i>; “but if you were to write
down such particulars, you would find it of
great assistance: as it appears very illiterate to
be unacquainted with those facts, which have
occurred in the history of your native country.
All the crosses you mention, were erected
by King <i>Edward</i> the first, in every place
where the funeral procession of his Queen
stopped from <i>Lincolnshire</i> (where she died) to
<i>Westminster</i>. There were in all ten, I think.
One at <i>Lincoln</i>, <i>Grantham</i>, <i>Stamford</i>, <i>Geddington</i>,
<i>Northampton</i>, <i>Stony Stratford</i>, <i>Dunstable</i>, St. <i>Albans</i>,
<i>Waltham</i>, and <i>Westminster</i>, called <i>Charing</i>
<i>Cross</i>. You should always endeavour to observe
what you read; but those things which
relate to the island in which you live, have a
particular claim to your remembrance. For
this purpose I think your present work is singularly
useful, as it will so strongly impress
the geography of your country upon your
mind, that I hope, my dear <i>Harriet</i>, you will
never forget it.” As nothing material happened
to my mistress, and very little variation
occurred in her manner of living, I shall pass
over the usual events of every day, which my
readers can easily imagine; such as her taking
me out of her pocket during the time of dressing,
and restoring me to that place of confinement
when she had concluded, and proceed
to relate an accident in which I was very
nearly concerned.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id016'>
<img src='images/i053.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>The kitten I have before-mentioned, who
was a great favourite with Miss <i>Meekly</i>, was
never allowed to enter her bed-chamber; but
one day, the weather being extremely warm,
and the door left open, it walked in, and laid
itself down at a little distance from the window,
in a spot where the sun shone; the shutters
being half closed to exclude the heat.
<i>Eliza</i> was employed in putting a pair of ruffles
into her jacket, and I lay in her lap securely
as I imagined, till a carriage stopping at the
gate, she precipitately jumped up to look out
at the visiters, and in her haste let me fall upon
the floor. Her motion was so sudden and
unexpected that I could not save myself, or
check the velocity with which I was impelled.
So that I unfortunately rolled on, till I touched
the edge of a bookcase; and discovered myself
to Mrs. <i>Puss</i>, who hooked me with her
claws, and twisted me round several times,
with as much dexterity as if I had been spinning;
or, to use a more proper simile, as if I
had represented a mouse. I afforded her great,
entertainment for some time, till at last I
found myself a second time under one of the
feet of the bookcase, and so fast wedged in,
that it was beyond the art of even a kitten’s
invention, to extricate me from my situation.
Mrs. <i>Stanley</i> coming up stairs, Miss <i>Meekly</i>
turned out my antagonist, and with unavailing
care searched for me in every drawer, on
every table, and upon the bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Long have I remained in this dull state of
obscurity and confinement, unable to make
known my distress, as I want the power of articulation:
at least my language can be only
understood to things inanimate as myself. A
pen, however, which fell down near me, engaged
to present these memoirs to the world,
if ever it should be employed by the hand of
kindness, to rescue my name from oblivion.
Should the eye of youth read this account with
any pleasure, it is hoped the candour of generosity
will over look its imperfections; and
should fate, in some fortunate moment of futurity,
again restore me to the possession of Miss
<i>Meekly</i>, or any of her companions, my gratitude
will engage me to thank the public for
its indulgence, and to continue the account
of my adventures.</p>

<p class='c009'>If I am not so happy as to meet with approbation,
I shall at least have the consolation
to reflect, that these pages have suggested no
wrong ideas to the youthful mind, have given
no encouragement to vanity, nor exhibited
any improper example with commendation;
which is what better Authors, and works of
higher genius cannot always be happy enough
to boast. Such as it is, I submit this account
of myself to the world, and only desire them
to remember, in the words of the admired
<i>Gay</i>, That</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>PART II.</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c010' />
<p class='c008'>I had lain so long in my dismal confinement,
that I began to despair of ever presenting
the world with any second part of my adventures.
And yet, thought I, it is very hard
that a <i>Pincushion</i> so new, so clean, and so beautiful,
that might have a thousand opportunities
of seeing the different manners of mankind,
should be thus secluded from company,
and condemned by the playful freaks of an
insignificant kitten thus to pass away its best
days in obscurity. And here let me take this
opportunity to suggest a useful hint to my
young readers, which, as my inactive situation
allowed me sufficient time for reflection,
I had frequently reason to feel the force of:
namely, That although I fretted and fumed
every day at my unfortunate condition, I
never found it was at all improved by it, or
that my ill-humour in the least degree made
me happier or assisted my escape.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id017'>
<img src='images/i057.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>When I determined to submit quietly, I was
as happy as any <i>Pincushion</i> in such a state of
retirement could be. But when in a cross fit
I tried to roll myself from under the bookcase,
I found the attempt was impossible to accomplish,
and I hurt my sides against the foot of
it. The space was so small between the bottom
of my prison and the floor, that I had no
hopes of escape, as it was impossible for any
broom to find its way under: or otherwise the
cleanliness of Mrs. <i>Stanley</i>’s maid would certainly
have effected my deliverance. But,
alas! of this I had no prospect; and though
my endeavours were fruitless, it taught me
such a lesson of contentment, as I wish every
little reader of my memoirs may remember,
and copy in their own conduct. For if they
are tired of working, reading, music, drawing,
or any other employment at home; or what
is frequently the case, are impatient of the
confinement of being at school, I would have
them take my advice, and try to amuse themselves
when they have opportunity, and wait
with patience till they are of a proper age,
either to leave the place they dislike, or have
overcome the difficulty of learning those accomplishments
which are necessary to be acquired.
For they may depend upon it, that
fretfulness and ill-humour will make every
condition unhappy: while a resolution to be
pleased, and make the best of every thing, is
the only method to be agreeable to others, or
comfortable themselves. The foot of the
bookcase, will press the closer, when we petulantly
try to escape: and though <i>children</i> are
not <i>Pincushions</i>, yet they will find, that whenever
they are fretful and dissatisfied, they will
be unhappy, and never succeed in any thing
they undertake. I hope I shall be pardoned
for this digression, but as the event of my
escape was so strong in my mind, I could not
pass it by without a pause of observation.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id009'>
<img src='images/i060.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>Let me now, however, proceed to inform
my readers, that one fine day, when I had determined
to make myself contented, and when
from the quietness in which I had been for
some days, I had reason to believe the family
were absent, and had therefore little hope for
release, on a sudden I felt the bookcase move,
and heard the sound of men’s voices, who, after
much pushing and hoisting, took away what
had so long covered me from the eye of every
beholder. In short, I found that Mrs. <i>Stanley</i>
had taken another house, as her lease was expired;
and in consequence of the removal of
her furniture, I regained my liberty. One
of the porters took me up, and blew off the
flew with which so long a confinement had covered
me, and taking me down stairs, presented
me to a chair woman, who was hired to
clean the house. “There, mother <i>Trusty</i>,” said
he, “is a present for you, which, if you please,
you may give to little <i>Jenny</i>: it will make
her as fine as a lady.” “Thank you,” returned
she, “I will keep it safe for my girl, and if you
have a bit of paper, I will wrap it up, for my
hands are wet and dirty, and when I take any
thing out of my pocket I may spoil it, you
know. But as to making her fine, <i>Jacob</i>, indeed
I do not desire it; and were you to present
any thing to wear, she could not have it; for
I think finery is not suitable for us. She is a
<i>good child</i>, <i>Jacob</i>, and that is better than being
a lady.” “Well, mother <i>Trusty</i>, do as you please,”
replied <i>Jacob</i>; “I do not know who the <i>Pincushion</i>
belonged to, so if you like <i>Jane</i> should have
it, why I am glad I found it.” So saying, he
complained that the weather was very hot, and
after wiping his face with a coarse apron, which
was tied round him, he drank Mrs. <i>Trusty</i>’s
health; and took a good draught of porter,
which stood on the table. He then sat down
to eat some bread and cheese, and calling a
great dog which lay in one corner of the kitchen,
made him sit up on his hind legs to beg
for some victuals, and afterwards bring him
his knot, which he very dexterously did, by
taking the buckle of it in his mouth, and
dragging it after him to his master. Another
trick which this animal had been taught, was
to shut the door at the word of command;
and his last performance to the entertainment
of my new Mistress and Mr. <i>Jacob</i>, was to
pick up his master’s wig and bring it upon his
head, which made indeed a very droll figure
to the spectators. At the conclusion or his
meal, <i>Jacob</i> bade adieu to mother <i>Trusty</i>, and
they each separated to pursue their different
employments. I was in the mean time laid
on one of the shelves, curiously wrapped up
in a bit of paper, which had fallen from the
back of that very bookcase under which I had
so long resided: it was torn in two by <i>Jacob</i>,
who took one half to put up some bits of cheese
rinds for his dog; and I found it was a fragment
of poetry, which I suppose had been sent
to Miss <i>Saxby</i>, as her name was <i>Martha</i>. I
amused myself with the perusal of the lines,
which were as follow:</p>

<p class='c011'>The business of the day being concluded,
the good mother <i>Trusty</i> shut up the house;
and taking me down from the shelf, put me
carefully in her pocket. We were not long
before we arrived at her habitation, which consisted
of two neat little rooms, in a small house,
about the middle of a very pleasant lane, A
clean looking boy and girl were sitting at the
door, with a coloured apron full of peas,
which they were very busily shelling. They
expressed great pleasure at the sight of Mrs.
<i>Trusty</i>, whom I found to be their grandmother,
and with much good-humour, told her they had
each earned a halfpenny; for that Mrs. <i>Traffick</i>
at the chandler’s shop, had given them one
penny, and promised them a farthing’s worth
of gingerbread, or a stale roll, for getting her
peas ready for supper. “Well, and I have
brought you home something,” replied Mrs.
<i>Trusty</i>, unfolding me to the child, who eagerly
getting up to receive her present, had nearly
overset the apron and its contents; but her
brother luckily caught it, so as to prevent the
peas from falling into the dirt. “But pray,
<i>Jenny</i> stay till you have done, and have washed
your hands,” said her grandmother; “for it
would be a pity to spoil this nice sattin <i>Pincushion:</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what have you brought for me?”
cried rosy <i>Dick</i>, as he emptied a handful of
peas into the bason. “Why nothing at all, my
good boy,” replied Mrs. <i>Trusty</i>, “but a piece of
bread and cheese: but I hope you are not
jealous that your sister should have any thing,
when you cannot partake of it?” “<i>Jealous!</i>” said
he: “No, I would go without any thing in the
world for the sake of my <i>Jenny;</i> and I will
give her my half-penny with all my heart,
though I have staid away from a nice game
at cricket on the green to earn it. When I
am a man you shall see how hard I will work,
and take care of all the money I get, and give
it to you, grandmother, to buy us victuals, and
drink, and cloaths; and you shall stay at
home and knit; but never, while I have any
health, shall you go out to such hard labour
as you now do.” “Blessings on my generous
boy,” exclaimed the tender hearted mother
<i>Trusty</i>, while the tears of affection rolled down
her aged cheeks. “Just such a man was thy
father <i>Dick</i>. While he was alive, we never
wanted for any thing. He was a good man,
indeed he was; and I hope that you will resemble
him. But go, my boy! carry home
your work, and bring the stale roll which you
was promised: it will be much better for you
than gingerbread.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id020'>
<img src='images/i066.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'><i>Jenny</i> kissed her brother, and thanked him
for his kind intention: “but we will give the
penny to our grandmother,” said she; “you know
she has got five pence three farthings which we
have had given us already; and when there
is enough we will ask her to buy you a pair of
new shoes; because those are too bad to walk
with.” Away ran <i>Richard</i> with the peas, and
returned in triumph with the roll; when the
little party sat down to supper, with that smiling
good-humour and cheerful contentment,
which is not always an attendant on the meals
of the rich and great. But when I saw how very
little was sufficient (or was obliged to be so)
for a woman who had been hard at labour all
day, and two little hungry children, I could
not help reflecting, how wicked it is in those
who are blessed with plenty, to be dissatisfied
with their food, and idly waste when they are
not disposed to eat it, that which would keep
the poor from starving, and which many an
unhappy child would be highly thankful to
receive. When they had concluded the meal
which their grandmother had brought them,
<i>Dick</i> ran to a neighbouring pump, to replenish
a broken red pitcher which had lost its handle
and a piece out of the top: and after they
had each of them drank with thirsty eagerness
he kissed his grandmother and sister, and wished
them a good-night, went quietly to bed.
Little <i>Jenny</i> followed her brother’s example,
as soon as she had laid me in a drawer with
great care, where all her treasures were deposited.
Among that number was a little paper,
which was nearly worn out with frequent
perusal, and with which I shall beg leave to
present my readers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps it may be thought an uncommon
effort for little <i>Dick</i> to turn poet at so early
an age, and with so few advantages from
education. But there is no answering for the
powers of natural genius, and many a one may
regard the attempt as <i>impossible</i>, merely because
they are too indolent to exert their faculties.
<i>Richard</i> had been taught to read and
write at the charity school of the parish where
he lived: and as no application had been
wanting on his part, the progress he made did
equal credit to his own abilities, and the attention
of his master, with whom his merit
made him a great favourite.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Jenny</i> was likewise put to a small school at
a little distance, by the benevolence of the vicar’s
wife, (with whom such instances were
very frequent) and by her assiduity recommended
herself to her mistress, who would
often propose her example as a pattern to the
rest of her scholars.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id022'>
<img src='images/i071.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>The next morning, when mother <i>Trusty</i>
got up to her daily labour, she kissed her
grand-children, and told then to go to school
early, and not stay and play afterwards: but
to return back again, for she would probably
come home to dinner. This they promised
to do; and after they had learned their lessons
they affectionately hugged each other
and diligently set forward with their books
in their hands. But <i>Jenny</i> in a few minutes
returned to fetch me, in order to exhibit her
new present to her school-fellows. We soon
arrived at a cottage, the apartments of which
were neither large nor numerous; but the exquisite
cleanness of it was truly admirable. The
mistress, whose name was <i>Markall</i>, was dressed
in a blue and white striped gown, which was
rather of the coarsest materials; but was put
on with the neatness of a Quaker, as was a
plain-bordered mob, with a white cloth binder,
and a coloured silk handkerchief; which,
with the addition of a checked apron, and a
black petticoat, will give a pretty good idea
of her appearance. She commended <i>Jenny</i>
for coming early, and having inquired after
her grandmother and brother, heard her read,
and repeat the lesson she had the day before
given her to learn. Soon after which, <i>Betsey
Field</i>, <i>Nanny Hay</i>, and the rest of the scholars
arrived; among which number were likewise
several boys. As the room door (which indeed
was the door of the house too) was left
open for the benefit of the air, and as one of
the forms where the girls were at work was
placed on that side, they were many of them
better disposed to watch the passing of a cart,
or a wheel-barrow; or to attend the flight of
birds, and butterflies, than to mind their
works: and Mrs. <i>Markall</i> punished several of
them, with a few strokes of a little cane,
which lay on her table for that purpose.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id023'>
<img src='images/i073.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>After she had heard them read, they stood
round her in a circle to spell; and those who
were so negligent as to mistake, lost their place
in the set, and exchanged with their more attentive
 companions. A precedency in the
ring was coveted with great ardour, and encouraged
a spirit of emulation among them,
as to stand first, (which was my mistress’s distinction)
was regarded as an acknowledgement
of superior excellence. When they had
finished their business, and the wished-for
hour of twelve struck, from the church clock,
which was very near Mrs. <i>Markall</i>’s house,
they all made their rustic courtesies and bows
to the Dame, and poured, like a swarm of summer
flies, into the lane. The whole body of
them stood a for a few moments to interchange
their mutual salutations: when some divided
to the right hand, and the other party to the
left, which led to the church porch; where
they seated themselves to be sheltered from the
intense heat of the sun; and <i>Jenny</i>, with a
smile of conscious satisfaction, produced me to
her companions. Though she was anxious to
display what she was so well pleased with herself,
yet she began to be apprehensive for my
safety, when the girls, with unpolished rudeness,
all scrambled for a sight of her present at
the same time. At last the two whole names
were above-mentioned, pursued <i>Polly Chaunt</i>
who was in possession of me, and after scuffling
on the grass, till <i>Nanny Hay</i> knocked her
head with great violence against one of the
tomb stones, and <i>Betsey</i> sprained her wrist in
trying to wrench me from <i>Polly</i>, she ran home
with the prize with so much swiftness, as to
outstrip all her competitors. What became
of poor <i>Jenny</i> I cannot tell, nor how she bore
the loss of me; but I could not help reflecting
how much better it would have been, had
these girls been sufficiently polite, to have
each satisfied their own curiosity, and then
have resigned me to the inspection of others.
Whereas, by all eagerly snatching me at once,
they dirted my outside, and pulled me quite
out of shape; together with making them all
very angry and foolishly commencing a quarrel,
of which the first consequences were the
wounds I have mentioned. <i>Polly Chaunt</i>,
whose property I so unjustly became, was the
daughter of the parish clerk. He was by trade
a shoemaker, and had three children, two
girls and a boy. His wife was a notable little
woman, who took care of some poultry, pigs,
and asses, which were allowed to feed upon a
green before the house.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id024'>
<img src='images/i076.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>As soon as my new mistress arrived at home,
her mother ordered her to prepare what was
wanted for dinner, at the same time telling
her, she was much displeased that she did not
return from school sooner. <i>Polly</i> answered in
a manner which convinced me, she was more
pert than prudent; and ran into a little back
wash-house to her sister, who was taking a
piece of bacon out of the saucepan, and who
likewise chid her delay; adding, that dinner
was ready, and she had been wanted to lay the
table cloth. In reply to this, she told the
history I have just related, and produced me
to her sister, who wiping her hands on a bit of
rag which hung on a nail in the window, took
me up to examine: When lo! <i>Polly</i> who was
at all times too hasty to attend to reason,
nor chusing that <i>Sukey</i> should touch me for fear
of spoiling my beauty, hastily snatched me
from her, and dropped me, not into the saucepan
which I escaped, but into a bason of soap
and water which stood near it, and in which
Mrs. <i>Chaunt</i> had just been washing her hands.
Upon this arose a quarrel between the sisters,
which was terminated by the entrance of their
father, who insisted on their bringing his
dinner immediately; and <i>Polly</i>, after having
carefully wiped, laid me on a clean handkerchief
to dry. I staid with this family some
days, and was witness to many disagreements
between the different parties which composed
it; but as I do not think the recital of illiberal
abuse could afford any entertainment
to my readers, I shall not trouble myself to
repeat it. But the folly of such behaviour
must be evident to every reflecting mind,
when it is considered, that although the
scenes I have mentioned passed in the low-life
of poverty, yet the same ill-humour, would
occasion equal animosity, in the most affluent
circumstances. And though no situation can
justify fretful petulance, yet, it was certainly
more excusable in girls, who were untaught
by education, and unpolished by politeness,
than in those, with whom the utmost care
has been exerted, and who have had all the
advantages of reading and instruction to contribute
to their improvement. That it is
possible for good-humour, and a determined
endeavour to please, in a great measure to
supply the deficiency of acquired graces, may
be seen in the characters of <i>Richard</i> and
<i>Jenny</i>, whose affection to each other must interest
every one in their favour: And the
same sweetness of temper, will likewise recommend
to my readers’ esteem, the agreeable
<i>Hannah Mindful</i>, to whom I was given one
<i>Sunday</i> afternoon by <i>Polly Chaunt</i>, in a walk
which they took together after church. And
sincerely glad was I to exchange mistresses, as
my last had been so ill-tempered and quarrelsome,
and had taken me in so unjustifiable a
manner, from the good-natured little <i>Jenny</i>.
<i>Hannah</i> was near fourteen years old and the
eldest of six children. Her mother was a
very worthy woman, but was afflicted with
such bad health, that she was seldom able to
leave her bed. Her father had a small farm,
and was very industrious in his business, and
very careful of his family; and I was quite
astonished to think, of how much service <i>Hannah</i>’s
attention proved to her brothers and
sisters; and what a comfort it was to her sick
mother, to have such a good girl, in whom
she could confide, and to whose care she could
entrust them.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id023'>
<img src='images/i078.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>After she had parted from my late owner, she
was met in her way home by the vicar, whose
lady was mentioned as the benefactress of my
favourite <i>Jenny</i>, and who with her husband
was returning to his house. He stopt at the
gate, and desired <i>Hannah</i> to wait there, or amuse
herself in the garden, while he went
to fetch a medicine which he had promised to
send to her mother; and at his return presented
her with a couple of fine peaches,
which he told her to eat, as she was a good
girl. She thanked him very civilly, and after
wishing him good-night, ran home as fast
as possible, for fear her mother should want
her; to whom she immediately presented her
present, without offering to taste them herself.
A niece of Mr. <i>Mindful</i>’s lived at this
time in his house, whose name was <i>Sally
Flaunt</i>; and who had been a half boarder at a
great school near <i>London</i>, where she was put
by a relation, whose death had left her no
friend but her uncle. She was entirely unprovided
for; yet was so inconsiderately proud,
as to make herself a burden to the family,
instead of trying to be of any service; which
she might have had sufficient opportunity of
being, as she was near fifteen, and very tall
of her age. When <i>Hannah</i> rose in the morning
to assist in getting breakfast, dressing her
sisters; and making the beds, <i>Sally</i> would disdainfully
turn round to sleep, because it was
in her silly opinion, unlike a lady to get up
early. Without any fortune, or the slightest
recommendation but her industry, she was ever
foolishly aiming at a rank in life, to which
she had no pretensions; and without sense to
distinguish, that it is gracefulness of manners,
and superior learning, that form the essential
difference between high life and poverty; and
that merit is as much entitled to respect in the
lowest circumstances of indigence, as in the
most exalted station, she was so weak as to
imagine, that by imitating some of those foibles
she had seen in girls who had more fortune
than understanding, she should be thought
to resemble them, and meet with that regard
which is not bestowed on riches, but on the
supposed worth of those who possess them.
While <i>Hannah</i> went up stairs to carry some
water-gruel to her mother, she dispatched one
of her little sisters to tell <i>Sally</i> that breakfast
was ready; but as she had slept so long, it
was some time before she could make her appearance;
and Mr. <i>Mindful</i>, who was justly
displeased with her indolence, told one of his
children to carry her milk away; for that
those who were too lazy to provide for themselves,
and to be ready at the proper time,
might go without food. When <i>Sally</i> therefore
came down, she was much disappointed to
hear, that a fast was for the present enjoined
as her portion; and looking very much out of
humour, she walked into the garden. He
followed her out; and as she was turning
round a little yew hedge which fronted a field
he took hold of her hand, and pulling her in
to the kitchen, told her, he was displeased
at her behaviour. “You are very foolish,
<i>Sally</i>,” said he, “because you have been to school,
to imagine that you have nothing further to
do, than sit with your hands before you, and
play the <i>fine lady</i>. You have no money to provide
for yourself, and there is no person will
take care of you, if you do not work hard to get
your bread. Behave as you should, and I will
treat you as my own child: but if you have
too much pride to know your duty, and will
not mind my advice, I will turn you out, to
try where you can live better than with me.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id018'>
<img src='images/i081.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'><i>Sally</i> knew she durst not reply to this positive
speech; and fearing her uncle should become
more angry, she promised to behave better,
and walked up stairs to <i>Hannah</i>, who was
dusting the furniture in her own room. To
her she related the above particulars, with the
tears running down her cheeks, and with the
most dismal sobs of distress and passion. My
good-natured mistress compassionately kissed
her, and wept to see her disturbance; but indeed,
my dear <i>Sally</i>, said she, I wish you would
try to exert yourself, and as you <i>cannot</i> be a
lady you had better endeavour to please my
father. You see, we all live very happily,
and I am sure I would do all in my power to
make you do so too: so cheer up your spirits,
and do not weep so sadly. “I cannot, replied
<i>Sally</i>, very crossly! indeed you may, who have
never seen any higher life: but where I was at
school do you think any of the ladies scoured
the rooms, or milked the cow, or went to such
work as washing and ironing? O! <i>Hannah</i>,
had you seen the caps, and feathers, and muslin
and gauze frocks, which they used to wear
on a dancing day, and how smart they looked
in their silk shoes, or else red morocco ones,
you would not wonder that I do not like these
great black leather things, (and she scornfully
tossed out her foot as she spoke.) Indeed,
<i>Hannah</i>, I could cry, whenever I see you and
your sisters cloathed in such coarse gowns, with
your black worsted stockings, and with that
check handkerchief on your neck, and your
round cloth caps, with that piece of linen for a
ribbon. I cannot bear it! and I wish I was
any thing, but what I am.” O, fie, <i>Sally!</i> said
<i>Hannah</i>, that is quite ungrateful for the good
things which you are blessed with, to talk in
such a manner as that. “What good things?
retorted the haughty girl raising her voice, and
growing more angry. Do you call this dowlass
shift, this coarse apron, this linsey woolsey
gown, <i>good things</i>? Or do you call the brown
bread we eat, or the hard dumplings you were
making just now, <i>good things</i>? And, pray
this old worm-eaten bed without any curtains
to it, and this little widow which is too small
to admit one’s head out, and what little hole
there is, quite crammed full of honeysuckles;
or this propped up chest of drawers, or that
good for nothing chair with a great hole in the
bottom, which you know <i>Bet</i> nearly fell
through yesterday, when she got upon it to
reach the box which holds her <i>Sunday</i> straw
hat, do you call these <i>good things</i>? because if
you do, I am sorry you know no better.” I
should be sorry indeed, rejoined <i>Hannah</i>, with
rather more displeasure than was usual to her,
if I knew so much of high life, as to be discontented
with what my father and mother can
afford. I think our bread is as good as any
body need wish for? and I am sure the dumplings
you so scornfully mention, will be very
well tasted and wholesome. As to the furniture,
if it is old, I will answer for its being
clean, <i>Sally</i>; and my father says, he can nail
a piece of board over that chair, which will last
as many years as the back does. And as to
our cloaths, I am sure they are whole and
tight; for I would work my fingers to the
bone, before I would see them otherwise. They
are coarse to be sure; but they are as good as
our neighbours, and many a one would be
thankful to have such to put on: and though
you speak so proudly of the house and every
thing in it, I have seen the ladies at <i>Oakly Hall</i>,
who are worth as much money as would buy
all the villages for twenty miles round, come
as kindly and sit down in my mother’s room,
and take hold of my hand, and my sisters, and
speak as prettily as if I had been a <i>lady</i> too;
without looking at the chairs, or finding fault
with the bed. And Miss <i>Goodhall</i>, although
she is dressed so handsomely, never seems to
think about it; and the last time she stopt here
took the loaf out of my father’s hand, and said,
let me cut Mrs. <i>Mindful</i> a piece of bread and
butter! I can do it very well, and it shall be
thin, such as I know she can eat. And she
brought with her a cannister of sago, and went
herself to the fire, and poured the water to
mix it, and put some wine into it, which she
brought with her; and showed me the way to
do it; with so much good-nature, that I do not
think you need be so very proud, <i>Sally</i>, and
look so unhappy about your situation. And
I assure you, she has sometimes eaten our
bread, and always said it was very good. <i>Hannah</i>
was here interrupted by one of her sisters,
who came to call her to assist her mother who
was going to get up. She attended her immediately,
and taking me out of her pocket, into
which she hastily put me at the conclusion of
the above conversation, she placed me on the
table, while she assisted Mrs. <i>Mindful</i> in putting
on a clean cap and bed-gown: and after she
had helped her to an old elbow chair, she made
the bed; which, as soon as she had finished,
she went into the garden, and returning with
a nice nosegay of flowers, placed them in a
little white stone mug upon the table, in order,
by their sweetness, to refresh and please
her mother, as she was very fond of them. She
then kissed her with great tenderness, and begged
her to take an egg beat up with some
milk, which she immediately got ready.
These little services were all performed with
so much alacrity and good-nature, and such
visible pleasure in her countenance, as doubled
the merit of all her actions. It was impossible
indeed to see her, without thinking how very
agreeable it is in the power of good-nature and
industry, to make those who have no other
advantages to recommend them.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id025'>
<img src='images/i085.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'><i>Hannah Mindful</i> was a healthy looking
country girl, her complexion was burnt by
the sun, and her hands hardened by laborious
toil: she was not ornamented by dress, though
her person was at all times made agreeable by
neatness: she had never been taught those
graces, which so forcibly recommend the possessor
to general observation; but a constant
cheerfulness, and a desire of obliging, which
was never interrupted by petulance, made her
beloved by every one who knew her. To be
as good-natured as <i>Hannah Mindful</i>, was the
highest praise of every girl in the village;
and every mother was ready to propose her
conduct, as an example to her own children.
If there was a piece of bread, which her
sisters liked better than the rest of the loaf,
she would save it for them by turns, whenever
she had opportunity. If any of them
went out to play, and forgot the business
which fell to their share, or which their mother
had ordered them to do, she would either
fetch them home again, or, (if in her power)
do it for them herself. By this she often saved
them from punishment. One day when her
father had brought two ribbons from a fair,
for her sister <i>Molly</i> and herself, he gave <i>Hannah</i>
the liberty of chusing first. She directly took
a pink, which was her favourite colour; and
left a dark green, which was what she most
disliked: but afterwards finding her sister
wished for the one she had chosen, she gave
it to her immediately, with as much readiness,
as if she had approved of the exchange from
the preference to the colour she disliked. <i>Sally</i>
told her she thought it was foolish to give up
what she had in her possession; but <i>Hannah</i>,
with a generosity which did great credit to
the goodness of her disposition, replied, that
she should never have worn with comfort,
what she evidently saw her sister was desirous
to obtain: and I declare, added she, I feel a
much higher gratification in the idea of giving
pleasure to my dear <i>Molly</i>, than I should receive
from any difference of colour, or from
a present of much greater value. <i>Sally</i> was
not of that opinion; for, the indulgence of
pride is the occasion of selfishness, and the
cause of the most despicable meanness. By
wishing for greater riches, and despising that
way of life to which she was destined, her
heart was constantly agitated by anxious vexation.
Whereas, <i>Hannah</i> was always cheerful,
good-humoured, and contented: and the
same incidents, which to the one were the occasion
of dissatisfaction and complaint, the
other submitted to, without repining, and rejoiced
with gratitude at the felicity of her lot.</p>

<p class='c009'>And thus, my young readers, will it be with
persons of higher rank, than those of whom I
am now writing. If you make yourself unhappy,
because some of your companions have,
more elegant cloaths, or a greater variety
than yourself: or because it may suit the fortune
of their parents, to make more splendid
entertainments, than the choice or circumstances
of yours will admit; if they ride in
their father’s carriage, while you walk on foot
and unattended, remember, that is no rational
cause of uneasiness. It is not the <i>station</i>, but
the propriety with which it is sustained, that is
the real matter of concern. A <i>beggar</i> may be
more respectable than a <i>Prince</i>, if he is sunk
to indigence by misfortune; and exerts his
utmost powers, to act with industry, and
maintain the proper conduct which his situation
requires. Let me advise you then, not to
wish for that finery, which would be unsuitable
to your circumstances; but to submit to
the discretion of your parents, because they
must know best what is proper for you. <i>Sally
Flaunt</i> had not the power to make her uncle’s
brown bread in the least degree whiter, although
she was too fretful to eat it with satisfaction.
She could not enlarge the rooms, or
repair the furniture, by her discontent; but
she might have been as happy as her cousin,
had she been disposed to be good humoured.
When any business is necessary to be performed,
if it is done with sullenness and ill-will,
it becomes the most laborious toil and
most irksome employment; but if it is executed
with cheerfulness, it is much sooner dispatched,
and the fatigue is considerably abated.
It is time, however, to return to my own
adventures, without trespassing longer on your
patience by my advice.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id018'>

<p class='c009'>I had continued some time with my mistress,
when Mr. <i>Goodall</i> (whose daughter I
believe I have before mentioned, gave an entertainment
to his tenants, on account of her attaining
her eighteenth year. Mr. <i>Mindful</i>,
out of kindness to his family, determined to
stay at home himself, and take care of his
wife, while he dispatched all the young ones
who were of a proper age, to enjoy an amusement
which would afford them so much pleasure.
<i>Hannah</i> dressed herself and two sisters,
as neat as rustic simplicity could adorn them.
They had each of them light brown stuff
gowns, white aprons and handkerchiefs, with
straw hats; her own with green and her sisters
with pink ribbons. They had all a nosegay
of flowers in their bosoms, and with the freshness
of innocence and health glowing in their
cheeks, prepared to set out for <i>Oakly Hall</i>.
<i>Hannah</i> did not forget to get ready every thing
she thought her mother might want in her absence;
and with a kiss off filial affection bade
her adieu.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id027'>
<img src='images/i094.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'><i>Jack Mindful</i>, her brother, was a lad of
about thirteen, very active and sprightly, and
sometimes apt to be extremely mischievous.
I have had no opportunity before this to introduce
him to the notice of my readers; but
the part he took in dressing his cousin for the
intended sport, will make it necessary to exhibit
him on the present occasion. <i>Sally</i>, whose
attention was wholly engrossed by the pride
of excelling her companions in the finery of
her cloaths, had been for some days busily employed
in mending an old silk coat, which had
been given her during her stay at school. It
had originally been ornamented with gauze
cuffs, which were grown dirty and yellow
with keeping: the rest of the trimming was
sufficiently decayed, to make it a rather despicable
garb: and Mrs. <i>Mindful</i>, who justly
thought such shabby finery very improper for
her niece’s situation, infilled upon her going
in a new garnet coloured stuff, which she had
lately bought her. This <i>Sally</i> was much distressed
at, and communicated her intention to
her cousin <i>Jack</i>, who promised to assist her in
her design; which was, after she had taken
leave of Mrs. <i>Mindful</i>, to carry her cloaths to
a barn at some distance, and there put on the
<i>silk coat</i>, which she imagined would make her
so much better respected by the family at
<i>Oakly Hall</i>. To this place she then repaired,
her heart beating with expectation, and flattered
with the imagination of outshining all her
companions. She had made up a new cap for
the occasion; and as she was very tall and
womanly in her appearance, thought if she
could make any substitute for a cushion it
would much improve her fashionable appearance.
On this great occasion, she borrowed
me of <i>Hannah</i>, who went before her cousin;
as she did not chuse to have any witness but
<i>Jack</i>, who was the only person entrusted with
this important secret. At the barn then we
soon arrived, and her stuff gown was thrown
off with disdain, while she prepared, with
the assistance of an old triangular bit of a
broken looking glass, to equip for the desirable
expedition. After placing the cushion,
which, she had taken great pains to complete,
and pinning her hair over it with a piece of
black ribbon, she put on her cap; which exhibited
the most taudry collection of old gauze,
bits of ribbon, and slatternly tassels, that can
well be imagined. At last came the trial of
the coat, which as it had been made very long
behind, was in that respect tolerable; but its
appearance in front was so short, as to be
really ridiculous. During the time she was
looking at her head in the glass, <i>Jack</i> in turning
round hastily threw it down a hole which
he had purposely contrived, and where it was
impossible to regain it, as it was so instantly
out of sight, that <i>Sally</i> had not an idea
where it had vanished, her search was totally
in vain, and she could only finish her
dress by <i>Jack</i>’s direction. He pretended to
admire her appearance extremely, and to make
it the more complete, he had before tied a couple
of sheep’s feet to a piece of ribbon, which
he now pinned to her shoulders, fastening them
close to her back with another string which he
likewise pinned down; and by way of addition
to the streamers in her cap, he suspended
a number of bits of straw, which he had tied
together with a piece of pack-thread. With
these burlesque ornaments she hurried with
him to the <i>Hall</i>; and as she was entering
the door which led to the house, under pretence
of fastening a piece of the trimming
which he said he could improve, he undid the
lower pins, and let the sheeps feet dance about
on her back, to the unspeakable entertainment
of every beholder. The laugh which her appearance
occasioned covered her with confusion:
and her pride was mortified in the highest
degree, to find her finery treated with such
a degree of contemptuous mirth; instead of
that admiration, with which she had flattered
herself.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id028'>
<img src='images/i095.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>The boys were eager to dissect her
head dress, and <i>Polly Chaunt</i>, who was of the
party, very maliciously pinned one of her cuffs
to the table cloth, as she was lolling her head
on her hand to hide those tears of vexation
which she could not forbear. Unfortunately
she rose in some haste, upon the appearance of
Mr. <i>Goodall</i>, who entered the room to welcome
his guests, and dragged down the salt-seller,
and several plates, knives, forks, and
spoons; which had they been brittle materials
would have been certainly demolished; but
as the whole service was of pewter, they escaped
unhurt. The bustle which this accident
occasioned, still more disconcerted the
unfortunate <i>Sally Flaunt</i>; who bursting into
tears very hastily left the room. In the angry
jirk, with which she walked away from the
company, her two shoulders were saluted with
the sheeps feet, in such a manner, as to make
her imagine she had received a blow, which
she turned round very quickly in order to resent:
but the agility of her motions, only served
to repeat the imagined offence, the author
of which, however, she found it impossible to
discern. But as she was going through an
apartment which led to the garden, she discovered
her own figure in a large pier glass;
the sight of which so fully completed her
vexation, that she determined to hurry home
immediately; and snatching her handkerchief
from her pocket to wipe her eyes, she whirled
me out with it to a considerable distance, and
without perceiving her loss, left me to enjoy
my own reflections. The thought of <i>Sally</i>’s
ridiculous vanity entirely took up my attention.
How happily might she have passed the
day had she been contented to do so in her
proper character; but by assuming a superiority
to her companions, she excited the contempt
of <i>Jack Mindful</i>, who was determined
to mortify her pride, by making her an object
of ridicule; and though his mischievous intention
was certainly extremely blameable, yet it
was her own folly which put the execution of
it into his power. Had she not determined
so meanly to deceive, and disobey her aunt,
by pretending to comply with her advice at
the very moment she was preparing to act in
opposition to it, she would have escaped that
mortification, which, however, it might excite
pity, was undoubtedly deserved.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id029'>
<img src='images/i098.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>I lay unperceived by the door of a little
closet till the next morning; when Mr. <i>Betty</i>,
who came to sweep the room, picked me up,
and laid me for some time on a marble slab;
after she had finished her business, I accompanied
her to breakfast. My new mistress was a
pleasing young woman, who was a housmaid
in Mr. <i>Goodall</i>’s family. She sat down with
the laundry-maid, whose name was <i>Joice</i>, and
who complained very much of the heat of the
weather, I have been so ill for some days
past, said she, that I can with difficulty stand
to wash; and the heat of the fire when I am
ironing makes me much worse than I should
otherwise be: and then Miss <i>Sophy</i> is so careless,
she never considers what will dirt her
cloaths, nor how much work she occasions. I
am sure her sister at her age was always neat
and nice, with half the number of frocks and
petticoats which she requires. I wonder that
a young lady should not have more compassion
for a poor servant. “That is because they
do not know the trouble it is, replied <i>Betty</i>;
but indeed <i>Joice</i>, Miss <i>Sophy</i>, is the same in
every thing. If she is cutting a piece of gauze,
or paper, she is sure to make a litter all over the
room; and I have often seen her cut a card
into a thousand bits on the carpet, without
making any use of it at all: and if she is undoing
her work, or picking her doll’s cloaths to
pieces, she will strew the threads on the floor,
without thinking how much trouble it gives
me to take them up again. But if she would
but put her bits of rubbish into a piece of paper,
it might be taken away without any difficulty.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i100.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c009'>She will never be beloved like her
sister, said <i>Joice</i>. And then she does not look
so much like a young lady; for <i>Jerry</i> says, that
when he is waiting at dinner, he cannot help
looking at her, to see how she leans against
the table, (that is one way in which she makes
her frock so dirty) and takes such great mouthfuls,
and eats so exceeding fast, as if she were
starving, and thought she should lose her dinner;
and sometimes she drinks without wiping
her mouth, and very frequently when it
is not empty. “O! I have seen her myself,
interrupted <i>Betty</i>; I have seen her when I have
waited at breakfast, grasp the spoon in her
hand quite down to the bowl of it, and my
mistress has told her it looked very unmannerly:
and then she altered it for a minute,
but has soon held it as awkwardly as ever.
But what I am most angry with her for, is
slopping her milk, or tea, on the tables, just
after I have rubbed them till they are as bright
as looking-glasses; and then she smears her
hands across, and all my labour goes for nothing.
I wonder how she would like this hot
day to have such violent exercise. But ladies
have often little consideration for their servants
feelings.” To be sure, said Mrs. <i>Joice</i>,
my master and mistress, and Miss <i>Goodall</i>, are
very good-natured, <i>Betty</i>; and Miss <i>Sophy</i> will
I hope, think more of the consequence of her
actions when she is older. I would do any
thing in the world for my mistress she speaks
so kindly, and when I am ill, she says,
“Take your time, <i>Joice</i>, and do not fatigue
yourself to-day, I hope you will be better
to-morrow.” I do not care how I slave when
people are considerate, and seem to think I
do my duty. During the latter part of this
conversation, Mrs. <i>Betty</i> had laid me on the
table, and was pinning her gown close, which
had before hung loose, only fastened with one
pin at the top, and the two sides turned behind;
and at the conclusion of it, Mrs. <i>Joice</i>
who had been clearing away the breakfast
things, folded me up in the table-cloth, and
carrying me under her arm to the poultry yard,
shook me out with the crumbs. She turned
round at the same time, to speak to a gardener,
who was emptying some seeds out of his blue
apron upon the dunghill, and did not see my
fall. After her departure, I was pecked at
alternately by almost all the fowls, till at last
I was tossed by a bantam hen, under a little
water tub, where I have lain ever since. My
last unfortunate adventure has so dirtied my
outside, that I should not now be known.
But if the recital of what has hitherto befallen
me has at all engaged the readers regard, I
hope I shall not lose their approbation, from
a change of situation or appearance.</p>

<p class='c009'>The catastrophe which has thus reduced
me, was entirely unexpected; and should
teach them, that no seeming security can
guard from those accidents, which may in a
moment reduce the prospect of affluence to a
state of poverty and distress; and therefore it
is a mark of <i>folly</i>, as well as <i>meanness</i>, to be
proud of those distinctions, which are at all
times precarious in enjoyment, and uncertain
in possession.</p>
